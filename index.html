    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      Accessibility in website design is important to me due to personal experience. My younger brother is dyslexic and during covid when his school was online a lot of the supplemental websites his school used was difficult for him to use to learn. A more accessible website would make an already difficult time for self teaching during covid even more difficult for him.

    <h2>CSCE 315 - Personal Website</h2></h2>
    <p>
      As a class we were tasked with creating a personal website using the people.tamu.edu domain. It was my first real project that used both HTML, CSS, and JS.
