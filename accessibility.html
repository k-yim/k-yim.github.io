    <p>
      Accessibility in website design is important to me due to personal experience. My younger brother is dyslexic and during covid when his school was online a lot of the supplemental websites his school used was difficult for him to use to learn. A more accessible website would make an already difficult time for self teaching during covid even more difficult for him.
